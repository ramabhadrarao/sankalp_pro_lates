Calculation Logic:
python# Human Life Value = Annual Income × Years to Retirement
hlv = annual_income * (retirement_age - age)

# Income Replacement Method
years_to_cover = (retirement_age - age)
annual_expenses = monthly_expenses * 12
expense_coverage = annual_expenses * years_to_cover

# Add liabilities
total_liabilities = sum(outstanding_liabilities.values())

# Subtract existing assets
liquid_assets = sum(investments.values())

# Required Coverage
required_coverage = expense_coverage + total_liabilities - liquid_assets

# Shortfall
shortfall = required_coverage - existing_term_cover

# Premium calculation (simplified)
age_factor = 1 + (age - 25) * 0.02
sum_assured = recommended_cover
monthly_premium = (sum_assured / 1000) * age_factor
Implementation Notes:

Use actuarial tables for premium estimates
Factor in inflation (7% default)
Consider dependent ages for duration
Store calculation in MongoDB for caching
Cache results for 1 hour
